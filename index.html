                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I'm Mohammed Aayan Pathan. I am 15 years old, and I am from Maharashtra, India. However, I currently reside in the UAE. I have been fascinated by technology since I was effectively a toddler, and ever since, I've been on a journey to understand and leverage technology for practically everything! I was born in Qatar, but I moved to the UAE several months later. I did my very early education in the capital, Abu Dhabi, until I moved to Dubai, where I joined kindergarten and continued my studies there, even to this day. I am currently in Year 11, on my second year of my iGCSE course in GEMS Founders School Al Barsha.</p>

            <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
            <p>I began my programming journey in Middle School (Year 7) during the pandemic's upheaval in 2020. Starting with Python, I aimed to grasp the basics of coding. I created projects like interactive quiz games and a simple "data-base" checker for Year 8.

                Later, I dabbled in crafting apps for Apple devices like the iPhone and Mac, using Swift and SwiftUI. However, this pursuit didn't fully satisfy me.
                
                After a year focused on my studies, I revived my programming interest. Web development stood out due to its accessibility and relevance. The field brimmed with options, technologies, and frameworks. I've been learning Vanilla HTML and CSS, adding touches of Vanilla JavaScript for website interactivity. With a solid foundation in these, I'm eager to explore frameworks like Tailwind CSS and React.js.</p>
