            <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
            <p>I began my programming journey in Middle School (Year 7) during the pandemic in 2020. Starting with Python, I aimed to grasp the basics of coding. I created projects like interactive quiz games and a simple "data-base" apps for my Year 8 class.

                Later, I dabbled in crafting apps for Apple devices like the iPhone and Mac, using Swift and SwiftUI. However, this pursuit didn't fully satisfy me, and I stopped doing it. 
                
                After a year focused on my studies, I revived my programming interest. Web development stood out due to its accessibility and relevance. The field brimmed with options, technologies, and frameworks. I learned the basic of web development, and am now learning new frameworks such as Node/Express and React/</p>
